# Solutions to **Introduction to Algorithms** *Third Edition*

## Getting Started

This **[website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)** contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [**Introduction to Algorithms** *Third Edition*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

Hope to reorganize solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, it's much more readable on portable devices now.

*"Many a little makes a mickle."*

Thanks to: the Instructor's Manual by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [@skanev](https://github.com/skanev), [@CyberZHG](https://github.com/CyberZHG), [@yinyanghu](https://github.com/yinyanghu), [@ajl213](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html), etc.

Special thanks to [@JeffreyCA](https://github.com/JeffreyCA), who fixed math rendering on iOS Safari in [#26](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/pull/26).

If I miss your name here, please tell me!

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/issues/new) in [my repository](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/).

## Working on following exercises

[18.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap18/18.2/#182-1), [19.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap19/19.2/#192-1).

I will continue to complete VII Selected Topics.

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) is now supporting more functions and is much faster than [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), I've updated all math equations from MathJax to KaTeX.

I also add `overflow-x: auto` to prevent the overflow issue on small screen devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.
